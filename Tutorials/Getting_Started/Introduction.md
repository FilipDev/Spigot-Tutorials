##Introduction
This repository contains numerous tutorials on how to effectivly create Bukkit plugins. Note that these are **not** Java tutorials and understanding Java is a prerequisite to writing Bukkit plugins. If you do not understand Java basics you should leave now and learn from [these](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/index.html) tutorials.

These tutorials are strictly code based. They will not go over how to setup your workspace, how to export your project, or the plugin.yml file. You can learn about the non code based portion of  plugin development [here](http://wiki.bukkit.org/Plugin_Tutorial).
